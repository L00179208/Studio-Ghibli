# Functional Testing

Undertaking functional testing in Postman permits one to validate the proper functioning of APIs by examining various aspects of their performance. The following areas warrant attention:

## HTTP Status Codes:

Verify that the API returns appropriate HTTP status codes, such as 201 OK for successful operations and 404 Not Found for nonexistent resources, as well as 500 Internal Server Error for server-side issues.

## Response Payload:

Examine the response payload to confirm that it contains the expected data. This entails verifying that the response body comprises the correct information, like the requested resources or data retrieved from a database.

## Response Headers:

Validate the response headers to ensure that they contain the necessary metadata and are correctly formatted. This includes headers like Content-Type, Cache-Control, and any custom headers specific to your application.

## Performance Check:

While functional testing primarily concentrates on verifying functionality, it is also crucial to perform basic performance checks to guarantee that the API meets performance requirements.
Monitor response times to ensure they adhere to acceptable limits. Identify any unusually slow responses or performance bottlenecks that may impact the user experience.
Assess throughput to gauge the API's ability to handle concurrent requests and process them efficiently.
Keep an eye on resource utilization, such as CPU and memory usage, to pinpoint any potential scalability issues or resource constraints.
By focusing on these aspects during functional testing in Postman, one can guarantee that APIs are not only functioning correctly but also performing adequately to meet the demands of the application and its users.

**Test Description**: The aim of this test is to assess the API behavior when required parameters are missing.
**Expected Outcome**: The API should return a clear error message specifying the missing parameters.

# 4. Robustness Scenario by Breaking the API:

## Scenario 9: Sending a Large Payload

**Test Description**: Send a request with a notably large payload.

## Scenario 10: Simultaneous Requests

**Test Description**: Send numerous concurrent requests to the API.
Expected Outcome: The API maintains stability and responds correctly to each request without crashing or becoming unresponsive.

# 5. Security Tests:

## Scenario 11: Authentication

The purpose of this test is to confirm that the API requires authentication to access sensitive endpoints. The expected outcome is that the API returns a 401 Unauthorized response when accessed without proper authentication.

## Scenario 12: Input Validation

This test is designed to evaluate the API's input validation by sending malicious or malformed data. The expected outcome is that the API rejects invalid input, thereby preventing potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

By carrying out these test case scenarios, you can guarantee the reliability, functionality, and security of the course API module.

# Validations

# TESTING TYPES

1. **Functional Testing**: This type of testing involves verifying that each function of the API operates as intended, based on the functional requirements. The approach involves testing each endpoint to ensure it performs the intended functionality, such as creating, updating, or deleting courses. The desired outcome is for the API to meet the specified functional requirements and function correctly.
2. **Automated Testing**: This type of testing utilizes automated tools and scripts to execute test cases without manual intervention. The approach involves writing automated test scripts using tools like Postman to perform functional and regression tests automatically. The desired outcome is to improve testing efficiency, speed up release cycles, and detect defects early in the development process.
3. **Load Testing**: This type of testing assesses the performance of the API under expected load conditions. The approach involves simulating multiple concurrent users or high volumes of requests to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure scalability. The desired outcome is to determine the API's capacity, scalability, and response times under various load conditions.
4. **Security Testing**:This testing phase involves identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in the API. To achieve this, common security issues such as injection attacks, broken authentication, and sensitive data exposure are tested for. The outcome of this phase is a secure API that adheres to security best practices and is protected against potential threats.
5. **Data-Driven Testing**:Data-driven testing is a testing approach that involves executing tests using a variety of input data to validate different scenarios. Test cases are defined with input data and expected outcomes, and multiple datasets are used to run the tests. The outcome of this phase is enhanced test coverage and the uncovering of defects that may only occur with specific data inputs.
6. **Regression Testing**:Regression testing is a testing phase that ensures that changes to the API do not introduce new defects or break existing functionality. After each change, existing test cases are re-run to verify that the API still behaves as expected. The outcome of this phase is the maintenance of the integrity of the API and the prevention of regression issues from affecting production.
7. **Mock Server Testing**:Mock server testing is a testing approach that involves testing the API using mock servers to simulate dependencies and external services. Mock servers are set up to mimic the behavior of external services, and the API's interactions with them are tested. The outcome of this phase is isolated API testing, faster test execution, and the minimization of dependencies on external systems.

Undertaking these testing types in the testing strategy for the course API module guarantees its dependability, effectiveness, safety, and adherence to functional prerequisites.
